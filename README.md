# 12_2023_first_git
First Github Repo for 12/2023 Class

## Hi this will be Kevin's first commit to the 12/2023 Repo!

I'm writing here to make a mistake and have conflict. Here it comes! Dodged a bullet, by fetching!

## Feature

You need to find (or create on your own) a website or app that you would like to add a feature to. 

*Kevin example feature is random google search*

### User Stories 

*remember user stories should be in the following format*

As a [persona], I want to [aspect of your feature], so that [buisness reason behind the aspect].

- As a tic-tak-toe competitor, I want to see a line over the winning squares, so that it is obvious why the winner won.

They should be potentially multiple user stories for each feature.

- persona
    eg. Facebook user personas
        - influncers
            * allow to promote content
        - average users
            * show feed
            * message friends
        - buisness
            * show buisness location
            * hours of opperation
            * have reviews
            * sell items
        - organization
            * promote content
        - group
            - admin
                * add members
            - member
                * see posts
                * respond


### Wirefames

Generally want (at least) 1 wireframe per user story.


## Kevin's Example
*Kevin example feature is random google search*

Persona -> Google user, Google Moderator
Feature -> random google search

As a google user, I would like a button to preform a random google search, so that I can discover new websites on the internet.

As a google user, I would like a way to track previously visited sites, so that I can remember the sites I have visted.

As a google user, I would like a way to preform a random google search from any webpage, so that I can always find something new without returning to google's homepage.

As a google moderator, I would like a way to remove sites from the random google search, so that our users do not see inappopriate or offensive content.
